Iâ€™m Anirudh Rajagopalan, B.Tech graduate with major in Computer Science and Engineering from NIT Tiruchirappalli (2018-2022). I graduated in the top 12% of my department at NIT-T and with a First Class with Distinction Degree. I did my thesis under the guidance of Dr.Kunwar Singh focused on practical privacy focused application of Advanced Cryptographical concepts. I explored various different fields during the four years of my undergraduate, from Blockchain to ML to Devops, leveraging the experience, talent and facilities provided in this top tier institution to learn and grow my capabilities.
Post my B.Tech, I joined Oracle as part of the Cloud AI Services team and am currently working on DevOps of the various micro-services on offer including translation, KPE and NER. I am incharge of release deployments and all internal testing and maintenance tools.
