I am a B.Tech graduate from National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli majored in Computer Science. I currently work with the Oracle Cloud AI Services Languages team focusing on continuous developement and deployment of microservices. I work with the cloud infrastructure, leveraging the capabilities offered by k8s and docker to maintain high performance and great efficiency of the several micro-services.
