Interest-based Advertising, sometimes called online behavioural advertising, uses data collected from online activity on a digital device (e.g. smart phone, tablet, computer, etc.) using cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies to show personalized ads. While interest-based advertising is invaluable in helping advertisers reach the most suitable audience for their products, user privacy could be better protected if it could be accomplished without collecting a particular individual’s browsing history. This paper aims to implement an amalgamation of cryptography techniques that leverage zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) cryptography and oblivious transfer (OT) alongside standard hashing and fuzzy logic to ensure that users’ sensitive, personal and private data is always kept secure.
