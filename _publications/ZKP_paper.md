Behavioural recommendations, utilizing data collected from online activity, is invaluable in helping advertisers reach the most suitable audience for their products. However, user privacy could be better pro-tected if it could be accomplished without collecting a particular individual’s data.
We provide a generic construction to leverage the classical Zero-Knowledge (ZK) protocol into a composable oblivious transfer (OT) protocol, preserving the ZK protocol’s round-complexity properties and security guarantees in the resulting OT protocol. Incorporating Fuzzy Logic, this amalgamation ensures that users’ sensitive, personal and private data is always kept secure when communicating with the recommender systems while not compromising the capacity of these systems to create cohorts of similar individuals.
