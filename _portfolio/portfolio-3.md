This was an attempt to create a vanilla blockchain from scratch providing security in a decentralised setup, leveraging on Proof of Work consensus mechanism. The blockchain (GenericCoin) leverages EC encryption and proof of work to mine new blocks and verify transactions. Truffle Suiteâ€™s Ganache and Metamask wallet were used in testing.
