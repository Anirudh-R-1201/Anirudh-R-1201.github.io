This methodology works for product-based recommendations (filtering similar products to current user purchases) and user-based recommendations (filtering products bought by similar users). We find similarity scores between products and users based on Nearest Neighbours by converting the review texts submitted by the user or for the product, with added weights based on whether the individual review is positive or negative.
