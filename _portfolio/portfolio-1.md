This methodology is works on product based recoomendation and user based recommendation. We find similarity scores between products and users based on Nearest Neighbours by converting the review texts submitted by the user or for the product, with added weights based on if the individual review is positive or negative. One set of Products are recommended based on the products the user has provided reviews for. The second set finds similar users and recommends the products with positive reviews given by them to the user.
