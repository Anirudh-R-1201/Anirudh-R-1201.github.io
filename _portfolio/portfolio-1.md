This methodology works on product-based recommendations and user-based recommendations. We find similarity scores between products and users based on Nearest Neighbours by converting the review texts submitted by the user or for the product, with added weights based on whether the individual review is positive or negative. One set of Products is recommended based on the products the user reviews. The second set finds similar users and recommends the products with positive reviews given by them to the user.
