An expected Goals model that presents the underlying number of perfomance, highlighting if a team or player is over or underperforming based on current stats. This was leveraged to indicate the trajectory of the performance for players in upcoming gameweeks, indicating who can be picked for the EPL fantasy teams and gain most points. The data was scraped from the Premier League's database as per Game Week 10 of 2020-2021 Season.
